Project Overview

This project classifies news articles as Fake or Real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model.
We combine two datasets (Fake.csv and True.csv), preprocess the text, vectorize with TF-IDF, and train the Logistic Regression model.

The trained model is deployed using a Streamlit web app for live predictions.

Steps to Run the Project

1. Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt



2. Train the Model

Run the main script to combine datasets, clean data, train, evaluate, and save the model:

python news_classification.py

This will create:

news.csv

fake_news_lr_model.pkl

tfidf_vectorizer.pkl




3. Launch the Streamlit Web App

To start the web interface for predictions:

streamlit run app.py




Usage of Web App

1. Enter any news article text in the text area.


2. Click Predict.


3. The app will display whether the article is Fake ❌ or Real ✅.
